title: Motivation For This Website
---

I want to explain here what I want my website to do and the motivations behind it. I wish to keep this website minimalist and strictly as a means to achieving the goal(s) listed below.

## Forgetfulness

I often get into a topic naively assuming I'll remember most of it, only to find that a few months down the line I've forgotten most.

To try solve this, I am trying to document as much as possible at peak knowledge. I started taking notes using markdown on GitHub and on notebooks and now I want an easy way to access and share these notes.

## Analysis Paralysis

Everything is a rabbit hole: what tech stack to use for your next app, what is best boiler to get, what accessories to put on your motorcycle, ....

There is a boundary after which the value of just thinking and researching about stuff becomes less than just doing it on the information you have at the moment, just making the mistakes while doing it, and hopefully gaining some experience by the end of it.

I often find it hard to identify where that boundary is, and find it easy to just continue analysing a given topic even when any extra thinking and researching has diminished value. Progress ends up slow, stress increases, motivation decreases.

To solve this, I've been trying to document what I currently know and what my thought processes were when a decision is made, and trust that any issues that arise can be solved later.
