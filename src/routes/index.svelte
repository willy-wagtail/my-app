	<h1 class="text-5xl font-bold mb-12 text-slate-800 text-center mb-10">Hi! I'm William.</h1>

	<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8">
		I'm a front-end developer and software engineer from Glasgow, Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø.
	</p>

	<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8">
		I'm currently on a career break after a decade of designing and developing software systems:
		firstly for Scottish Government where I worked on Disclosure Scotland's criminal record check
		systems, then JP Morgan Chase where I built order management systems for their banking products.
		I hold a masters degree in pure mathematics from University of Glasgow.

	<p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8">
		Outwith work, I'm abit of a hobby slut and get easily seduced into those rabbit holes in
		whatever random topic is of interest to me at that particular time: from garden birds to
		computer networking and self-hosting apps, from cycling to motorbikes, pottery, electronics, or
		video games ...
	</p>

	<p class="text-lg text-slate-700">
		The goal with this website is to make it easy for me to access
		<a
			class="border-b focus:border-b-0 border-blue-600 hover:text-blue-600 focus:outline-blue-600"
			href="/notes">my notes</a
		>. I often find myself getting into something, only to find I've forgotten alot of it a few
		months down the line. (It's also an excuse to try Svelte!)
