		Hi! I'm William.
	</h1>

	<p class="mb-8">I'm a front-end developer and software engineer from Glasgow, Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø.</p>

	<p class="mb-8 text-justify">
		I'm currently on a career break after a decade of designing and developing software systems:
		firstly for Scottish Government where I worked on Disclosure Scotland's criminal record check
		systems, then JP Morgan Chase where I built order management systems for their banking products.
		I hold a masters degree in pure mathematics from University of Glasgow.
	</p>

	<p class="mb-8 text-justify">
		Outwith work, I get easily seduced into rabbit holes in topics of interest to me at that
		particular time: from garden birds and pottery to computer networking and self-hosting
		applications, from cycling to motorbikes ...
	</p>

	<p>
		The goal with this website is to make it easy for me to access
		<a class="app-link" href="/notes">my notes</a>. I often find myself getting into something with
		the assumption that I'll remember it all, only to find I've forgotten most of it a few months
		down the line. (This is also an excuse to try out Svelte and Sveltekit!)
